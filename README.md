# CPE 551 Project
## Card Game

For this project I created a card game using object oriented programming (OOP). The card game I developed is similar to the game Crazy Eights. 

To run this code clone the GitHub repository. Open a terminal, change directories to the folder where you downloaded the repository and type the command "python cardgame.py"

The game instructions are listed below: 

### INSTRUCTIONS: 
GENERAL SETUP:

- 2 player game (computer vs user)
- Each player is dealt 7 cards (a standard 52 card deck is used to deal)
- After each player is dealt their hand, the next card from the deck is flipped face up as the starting card for the discard pile
-  The player to go first will be randomly selected

GAME FLOW: 

- Players takes turns placing a card from their hand into the discard pile
- The card a player places down must match either the suit or the rank of the top card in the discard pile


WILD CARDS: 

- An 8 represents a wild card; these can be placed on top of any card.
- Additionally when an 8 is played, the player gets to choose the suit they want to be followed

DRAWING CARDS:

- If a player doesn't have any cards they can play they must draw a card from the deck.
- The players turn is over after they draw. They do not get to play the card even if its playable 


HOW TO WIN: 

- The first player to get rid of all their cards wins!


EMPTY DECK WITH NO WINNER YET: 

- If the deck is empty and there is not yet a winner, the person who currently has less cards in their hand wins!
- If both players have the same amount of cards in their hand, the game ends in a tie
